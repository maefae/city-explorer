## Overview
Let's the client search for a city name in the search bar and after clicking "explore now", the site displays the name and coordinates of the searched location and an image which depicts a map of the location. Error codes are displayed to the corresponding error.

<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
1. Create a new local repo with the "create-react-app" command.
2. Install axios with the "npm i axios" or "npm install axios" command.
3. Install bootstrap by typing "npm i bootstrap react-boostrap" into terminal.
4. Link locationsIQ API by creating an env. file and adding key. file
5. create a form to query LocationIQ for coordinates
6. WRite code to display coordinates, location name, and map image after location search.
7. Write code to display error msgs for when an error occurs
